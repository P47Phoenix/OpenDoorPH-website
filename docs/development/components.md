## üìÑ Page Components

**Type**: Functional Component  
**Purpose**: Primary landing page content  
**Location**: `src/Pages/Main.js`

#### Component Structure
```javascript
export const Main = () => {
    return (
        <div>
            <p>
                Open Door Full Gospel is committed to being a rock solid church through prayer,
                bible study, and community service. We strive to reach out to the community in any
                way we can. We provide solid foundations through biblically sound programs for youth,
                children, Nursery, and young adults (classes coming soon). Our pastor, Dennis Gulley,
                brings the truth of the Bible and applies it to everyday life.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the summer of 2009 we held a clothes drive. All the clothes we gathered were
                given away to the community free. We also held our first annual Vacation Bible School.
                In the fall of 2009 we held a food drive. All the food gathered was donated to Harvesters.
                We were able to help pack boxes of bread to be sent out into community pantries.
                At the end of 2009 we were privileged to be able to work with Uplift in feeding
                the homeless. Coats, sleeping bags, clothes, and food were gathered to be donated
                to the organization. We are looking forward to being able to work with them again
                and encourage all to look into what a wonderful group this is.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2010 we will be working with Kansas City Rescue Mission to prepare and serve
                hot meals to the homeless. Plans are under way for our Second annual VBS as well
                as plans to work with Uplift again. These are just a few of the things going on
                at Open Door. Come by and experience the love of Christ. We would love to have you
                as part of our church family.
            </p>
        </div>

## üé® Styling and Assets

### CSS Integration
Each component utilizes CSS classes for styling:

#### Global Styles
- `src/App.css` - Application-wide styles
- `src/index.css` - Base HTML and body styles

#### Component-Specific Styles
- Header styling for branding and navigation
- Sidebar styling for service information
- Content area styling for readability
- Responsive design considerations

---

## üîÑ State Management

### Current State Approach
- **No Global State**: Components are primarily presentational
- **Local State**: Minimal local state usage
- **Props Flow**: Simple parent-to-child data flow

### Future State Considerations
- **Context API**: For shared application state
- **Redux**: For complex state management needs
- **Local Storage**: For user preferences

---

## üß™ Testing Considerations

### Component Testing Strategy
```javascript
// Example test structure for components
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';

// Test wrapper for router-dependent components
const renderWithRouter = (component) => {
    return render(
        <BrowserRouter>
            {component}
        </BrowserRouter>
    );
};

// Component-specific tests
test('SideBar displays service time', () => {
    render(<SideBar />);
    expect(screen.getByText('Morning Service: 10:15 AM')).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

---

## üìà Performance Considerations

### Component Optimization
- **Functional Components**: Lighter weight than class components
- **Code Splitting**: Potential for lazy loading of page components
- **Memoization**: Opportunities for React.memo optimization

### Rendering Optimization
- **Static Content**: Most components render static content
- **Minimal Re-renders**: Simple component structure reduces re-render complexity
- **Image Optimization**: Properly sized images for performance

---

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

### Component Improvements
- **TypeScript**: Type safety for component props and state
- **Hooks Migration**: Convert class components to functional components with hooks
- **Accessibility**: Enhanced ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- **Animation**: Smooth transitions and micro-interactions

### New Component Opportunities
- **EventCard**: For church events and announcements
- **ContactForm**: For visitor inquiries
- **NewsletterSignup**: For community engagement
- **DonationButton**: For online giving capabilities
