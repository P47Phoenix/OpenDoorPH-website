                Open door was founded by Herbert & Willetta Lowry and William & Mable Burnett in
                July of 1975. Services were first held in an old house on the corner of Cedar and
                Campbell. There were 35 people in attendance at the first service. The founders
                asked Harvey Bryant to pastor the church. Pastor Bryant bought the churches current
                building after it was damaged by smoke from a neighboring building. The church later
                bought the building from Pastor Bryant.
