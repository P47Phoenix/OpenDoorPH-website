            Open Door Full Gospel is committed to being a rock solid church through prayer,
            bible study, and community service. We strive to reach out to the community in any
            way we can. We provide solid foundations through biblically sound programs for youth,
            children, Nursery, and young adults (classes coming soon). Our pastor, Dennis Gulley,
            brings the truth of the Bible and applies it to everyday life.

            In the summer of 2009 we held a clothes drive. All the clothes we gathered were
            given away to the community free. We also held our first annual Vacation Bible School.
            In the fall of 2009 we held a food drive. All the food gathered was donated to Harvesters.
            We were able to help pack boxes of bread to be sent out into community pantries.
            At the end of 2009 we were privileged to be able to work with Uplift in feeding
            the homeless. Coats, sleeping bags, clothes, and food were gathered to be donated
            to the organization. We are looking forward to being able to work with them again
            and encourage all to look into what a wonderful group this is.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2010 we will be working with Kansas City Rescue Mission to prepare and serve
            hot meals to the homeless. Plans are under way for our Second annual VBS as well
            as plans to work with Uplift again. These are just a few of the things going on
            at Open Door. Come by and experience the love of Christ. We would love to have you
            as part of our church family.
