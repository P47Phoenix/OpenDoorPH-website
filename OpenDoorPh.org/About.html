		Open door was founded by Herbert & Willetta Lowry and William & Mable Burnett in
		July of 1975. Services were first held in an old house on the corner of Cedar and
		Campbell. There were 35 people in attendance at the first service. The founders
		asked Harvey Bryant to pastor the church. Pastor Bryant bought the churches current
		building after it was damaged by smoke from a neighboring building. The church later
		bought the building from Pastor Bryant.
	</p>
	<p>
		Open door was led for some time by Pastor Bryant. After which it was also led by
		Don Sherwood, Lauren Simmons, Jim Coons, Roger Nichols, Sam Meyers, and then Dennis
		Gulley; whom is still currently at Open Door. We invite you to come and experience
		the wonderful things God is doing at Open Door!
