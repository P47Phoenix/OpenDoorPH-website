## ✅ COMPLETED: React Router Testing Issues RESOLVED

### What Was Fixed
- **Router-in-Router Error**: Removed redundant BrowserRouter wrapper in tests
- **Multiple Element Conflicts**: Updated test assertions to handle duplicate text elements
- **CI Configuration**: Enhanced test script with proper CI environment settings
- **Test Coverage**: Maintained 100% coverage for App component

### Commits
- `4f6efa0` - Fix: Resolve React Router testing issues
- `fa61df3` - Integrate Amazon Global Constructs framework

## 🚨 CRITICAL NEXT STEP: Repository Secret Configuration

### Required Action
The **AWS_ROLE_ARN** repository secret must be configured to enable deployment:

1. Go to: **GitHub Repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**
2. Click: **"New repository secret"**
3. Name: `AWS_ROLE_ARN`
4. Value: `arn:aws:iam::785341741686:role/GitHubActionsRole-CDKDeploy`

### Why This Is Critical
- Without this secret, the GitHub Actions workflow cannot authenticate with AWS
- The enhanced workflow with Amazon Global Constructs requires OIDC authentication
- This is the **only remaining blocker** for full deployment functionality

## 📋 Current Status Summary

| Component | Status | Details |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Tests** | ✅ Fixed | All React Router issues resolved |
| **AWS Integration** | ✅ Complete | Amazon Global Constructs framework integrated |
| **Workflow Enhancement** | ✅ Complete | OIDC auth, artifact sharing, caching |
| **Documentation** | ✅ Complete | Comprehensive guides and setup instructions |
| **Repository Secret** | ⚠️ **PENDING** | **AWS_ROLE_ARN secret configuration required** |
| **End-to-End Validation** | ⏳ Waiting | Depends on repository secret |

## 🚀 Ready for Deployment

Once the repository secret is configured:
- The enhanced CI/CD pipeline will be fully operational
- Secure deployment to AWS S3 and CloudFront will work
- The workflow includes comprehensive error handling and monitoring
